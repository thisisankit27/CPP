Static  Variables:
Static variables have a property of preserving their value even after they are out of their scope!
Hence, static variables preserve their previous value in their previous scope and are not initialized again in the new scope.
Value is sustained ever after exiting a function.
Example: Print 1 to N withiout using loops.
